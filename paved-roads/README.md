# Paved Roads

## Overview

This directory contains design documents for CloudOps Paved Roads - proven, packaged solutions for common cloud infrastructure and operational challenges. Each paved road represents a solved problem with established patterns, best practices, and implementation guidance.

Paved roads provide teams with:
- **Pre-validated architectures** that have been tested and proven in production
- **Implementation blueprints** with clear steps and requirements
- **Design considerations** including trade-offs and decision points
- **Operational guidance** for maintenance and troubleshooting
- **Reference implementations** where applicable

## Purpose

Paved roads eliminate the need to solve the same problems repeatedly. By documenting proven solutions, teams can:
- Accelerate delivery by leveraging known patterns
- Reduce risk through battle-tested approaches
- Maintain consistency across implementations
- Share knowledge across teams and projects
